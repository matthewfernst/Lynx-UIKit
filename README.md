## About Project

This project is the source code for the companion app for [Mountain UI](https://github.com/matthewfernst/Mountain-UI)! You can download this app in the [Apple App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/lynx-mountain-ui/id6451053614) to quickly upload your skiing/snowboarding data and
have your stats displayed on your Mountain-UI display. Add friends and be able to compete on leader boards and see who is on top all at a glance at your iPhone or your Mounatin-UI display.
